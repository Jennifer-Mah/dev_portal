	<p>
	My name is Jennifer Mah. I am currently a Junior majoring in TAM and have a business minor. After I graduate from this degree program I hope to work as a web developer or app developer. I have a huge passion for teaching. In my free time I like to bake, practice yoga, and hike with my dog Tamu. I love to travel and can’t wait to see more of the world. Fun fact about me is I am a triplet. My two other sisters go to school at University of Michigan and Purdue.</p>


	<p>
	I’m pretty experienced in web technologies. I have been surfing the web for half my life and grew up in the age of the internet. I have taken a few web development classes which include Web and Front End Development. I feel like I’m always learning new things about web development. I have quite a bit of experience with JavaScript and Jquery along with API integration and some data base integration. I am also interested in developing because I love the creative aspects of web design and the problem solving involved in figuring out algorithms. 

	</p>
	I would like to work more with Node and frameworks. Although we worked a little bit with a framework in Front End Development I felt it was quite a small amount of time to work with a framework. The frameworks were a challenge that I would like to continue to work with.
